            <h1>Boosts</h1>
            <p>Boosts in Minecraft Earth can be used to enhance your characters abilities. They are similar to potions
                in vanilla Minecraft.</p>
            <img src="/img/boosts.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>There are 12 different boosts in Minecraft Earth which all grant you with a special ability/upgrade for a
                short amount of time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To view your boosts tap the lightning bolt icon on the sidebar on the map screen.</p>
            <p>Just like with potions, there are 3 different strength levels for each boost. The higher the level is the
                longer the boost will stay active and the better its ability is.</p>

            <img src="/img/xp_boost.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img">
            <p>You can earn boosts by logging in daily and by <strong>completing daily challenges and tappable challenges</strong>. They can also be collected from season
                challenges and bought in the store in exchange for rubies.</p>
            <p>You can use up to <strong>5 boosts at once</strong>. However each boost token can only be used once, so be sure to save some for
                when you most need them!</p>
